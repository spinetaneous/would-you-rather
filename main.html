  <!-- Enclose the title of the page in <h1> tags. -->
  <!-- This means "header 1" which will make the text appear larger
  and at the top of the screen. -->
  <h1>Would you rather...</h1>

  <!-- TO ADD CHOICES:
  1. Enclose your code in a <div> tag. This means division.
  In other words, you are packing parts of your code together
  into its own group, or class. Please give this class a name.
  This is so that you can style all members of this class
  all at once later instead of one at a time.

  2. Next, add the button by using the <button> tag.
  We will also put these into their own class.

  The line onclick="window.open('choice1.html', '_blank');"
  will open a choice in a new tab (you can forego the new tab by
  taking out _blank).

  3. Style your div and button classes as you wish.

  // FIXME fix comments to reflect arrays-->
  <div class="choice">
    <!-- choice 1 -->
    <div id="choice1">
      <input type="button" class="button" id="button1"
      value= ""
      onclick="window.open('choice1.html', '_blank');">
      </input>
    </div>

    <p>OR</p>

    <!--choice 2 -->
    <div id="choice2">
      <input type="button" class="button" id="button2"
      value=""
      onclick="window.open('choice2.html', '_blank');">
      </input>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- use src to reference an external javascript file -->
  <!-- please note that when using src, the script tag should be empty -->
  <script text="text/javascript" src="choices.js"></script>
  <script>
  getChoice1();
  getChoice2();
  </script>
