  <!-- Enclose the title of the page in <h1> tags. -->

  and at the top of the screen. -->
  <h1>Would you rather...</h1>

  <!-- TO ADD CHOICES:
  1. Enclose your code in a <div> tag. This means division.
  In other words, you are packing parts of your code together
  into its own group, or class. Please give this class a name.
  This is so that you can style all members of this class
  all at once later instead of one at a time.

  2. Next, add the button by using the <button> tag.
  We will also put these into their own class.

  The line onclick="window.open('choice1.html', '_blank');"
  will open a choice in a new tab (you can forego the new tab by
  taking out _blank).

  3. Style your div and button classes as you wish.

  <!-- choice 1 -->
  <div class="choice">
    <button class="button" onclick="window.open('choice1.html', '_blank');">...have ears for eyes?</button>
  </div>

  <p>OR</p>

  <!--choice 2 -->
  <div class="choice">
    <button class="button" onclick="window.open('choice2.html', '_blank');">...have eyes for ears?</button>
  </div>
</body>
